Going into the 2018 academic year, SIU Robotics was preparing to build a total of seven robots to compete at various competitions across the United States. I asked to lead a design team to build one of those robots that would go on to compete at Robobrawl 2019. While I had previous experience building robots for obstacle course and task based competitions, this was my first time building a combat robot. 

Robobrawl is a 30 pound robot combat competition held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The objective of the competition is straight forward, two robots enter the arena, one robot leaves. While this may sound quite simple, designing a robot optimized for combat requires an extensive background in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. Every pound spent in one place is a pound away from others.

As it was my first time building a combat robot, we took inspiration from exiting combat robots, and we tried to make improvements where we could. We took our heaviest inspiration from a 30 pound combat robot named Crippling Depression, which had competed at different competitions in years prior. We liked the drive train setup used by CD, but we felt that we could improve the dimensions, armor, and materials used. We reduced the dimensions of some of the largest parts used in CD to save weight, which was subsequently added to the armor. We made the armor modular, with two different configurations. Finally, we used 7075 aluminum alloy instead of 6061 aluminum alloy for internal supports, since they don't take direct hits but need high rigidity for the whole structure.

Absaluki 3's drive train was fully encased in Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMW), which is a slippery, bendable plastic. This prevented anything from getting out of alignment, while resisting permanent deformation from large impacts. The slipperiness helped so if something did get out of alignment, the resistance from friction wouldn't be too much. We used brushless motors for driving which allowed us to reduce the size and weight of the drive motors. Despite taking multiple large impacts, our drive train never stopped working the entire competition.

The weapon system on Absaluki use a single tooth disk spinner that would spin at about 8,000 RPM. Unfortunately, we never got our weapon system fully working during the competition. The tension on the belt connecting our motors to the weapon was too high, and the motors would start smoking only seconds after activating the weapon. On top of that, our weapon was severely damaged in an early fight, and was replaced with an octagonal piece of polycarbonate. From there on, our robot only weighed 22 pounds at a 30 pound competition and fought by ramming into opponents!

The armor on Absaluki 3 was modular, and we made two configurations. The first was composite armor, with steel on the outside for resisting impacts from hard objects, a layer of Kevlar in the middle for absorbing the kinetic energy of impacts, and 6061 aluminum alloy on the inside for catching anything that makes it past the Kevlar, while also providing structural support. The other armor set featured 6061 aluminum alloy with steel hinged wedges surrounding the robot, making it difficult to get underneath our robot. We used the composite armor in our very first fight, however with our weapon system not working well, we switched to the hinged wedge armor for the rest of the competition, since it allowed us to easily get underneath other robots and push them around.

Absaluki 3 went on to win first place at Robobrawl. Every single round we fought was won by knockout, without a functional active weapon. As such, I like to say we won most of our fights not by winning, but by making the opponent lose. One of our opponent's chassis was so low to the ground, it got high sided on a bolt that had fallen off our robot from a large impact. Another opponent with an extremely sharp front wedge rammed the arena wall and the wedge got jammed long enough for a count out. We did win a couple of fights by ramming our opponent until something on their robot broke, a testament to the durability of Absaluki.
