Going into the 2018 academic year, SIU Robotics was preparing to build a total of seven robots to compete at various competitions across the United States. I asked to lead a design team to build one of those robots that would go on to compete at Robobrawl 2019. While I had previous experience building robots for obstacle course and task based competitions, this was my first time building a combat robot. 

Robobrawl is a 30 pound robot combat competition held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The objective of the competition is straight forward, two robots enter the arena, one robot leaves. While this may sound quite simple, designing a robot optimized for combat requires an extensive background in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. Every pound spent in one place is a pound away from others.

As it was my first time building a combat robot, we took inspiration from exiting combat robots, and we tried to make improvements where we could. We took our heaviest inspiration from a 30 pound combat robot named Crippling Depression, which had competed at different competitions in years prior. We liked the drive train setup used by CD, but we felt that we could improve the dimensions, armor, and materials used. We reduced the dimensions of some of the largest parts used in CD to save weight, which was subsequently added to the armor. We made the armor modular, with two different configurations. Finally, we used 7075 aluminum alloy instead of 6061 aluminum alloy for internal supports, since they don't take direct hits but need high rigidity for the whole structure.

Absaluki 3's drive train was fully encased in Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMW), which is a slippery, bendable plastic. This prevented anything from getting out of alignment, while resisting permanent deformation from large impacts. The slipperiness helped so if something did get out of alignment, the resistance from friction wouldn't be too much. We used brushless motors for driving which allowed us to reduce the size and weight of the drive motors. Despite taking multiple large impacts, our drive train never stopped working the entire competition.

The weapon system on Absaluki use a single tooth disk spinner that would spin at about 8,000 RPM. Unfortunately, we never got our weapon system fully working during the competition. The tension on the belt connecting our motors to the weapon was too high, and the motors would start smoking only seconds after activating the weapon. On top of that, our weapon was severely damaged in an early fight, and was replaced with an octagonal piece of polycarbonate. From there on, our robot only weighed 22 pounds at a 30 pound competition and fought by ramming into opponents!

The armor on Absaluki 3 was modular, and we made two configurations. The first was composite armor, with steel on the outside for resisting impacts from hard objects, a layer of Kevlar in the middle for absorbing the kinetic energy of impacts, and 6061 aluminum alloy on the inside for catching anything that makes it past the Kevlar, while also providing structural support. The other armor set featured 6061 aluminum alloy with steel hinged wedges surrounding the robot, making it difficult to get underneath our robot. We used the composite armor in our very first fight, however with our weapon system not working well, we switched to the hinged wedge armor for the rest of the competition, since it allowed us to easily get underneath other robots and push them around.

Absaluki 3 went on to win first place at Robobrawl. Every single round we fought was won by knockout, without a functional active weapon. As such, I like to say we won most of our fights not by winning, but by making the opponent lose. One of our opponent's chassis was so low to the ground, it got high sided on a bolt that had fallen off our robot from a large impact. Another opponent with an extremely sharp front wedge rammed the arena wall and the wedge got jammed long enough for a count out. We did win a couple of fights by ramming our opponent until something on their robot broke, a testament to the durability of Absaluki.

Our first fight was up against Devestating Wind, an eggbeater style robot. This was my first time driving Absaluki, and it shows. We chose to go with the composite armor, because we were worried the eggbeater might be able to rip some of the wedgelets off. Immediately, our weapon failed to spin up, so we quickly changed tactics and tried ramming our opponent. We spent a good part of the fight spinning around in circles, but a few good rams disabled their robot and got us the win. After some calibrations, we got the robot driving better for the second fight.

Our third fight (in the second fight the other robot was so damaged in their first fight they were unable to continue, giving us a pass) was against Botman, a particularly nasty vertical spinner. We were not looking forward to this fight after seeing what it had done to other robots. Before this fight, we spent some time trying to fix the weapon, and did some calibrations to get the robot driving better. Since Botman relies on getting underneath opponents to lift them into their weapon, we went with the wedgelet armor. Once again, our weapon failed to spin up, and actually let out a little smoke as the belt burned up. Again, we quickly resorted to ramming our opponent, but this was a dangerous strategy. One of our wedgelets got knocked off early in the fight, and this removed the bolt holding it in place. After a devastating blow to our weapon, we pushed Botman onto the bolt that was knocked loose. Botman ended up getting high sided on it, and we won a knockout victory.

Our fourth fight was against Wall-F, the Robobrawl 2018 champion. Wall-F is a lifter bot that had won most of its fights by lifting robots onto their sides, or by picking them up and dumping them out of the arena. Our wedgelet armor was specifically designed to prevent these kind of attacks, so we went with the wedgelet armor. Our weapon was badly bent out of shape from the hit from Botman, so we took it off and replaced it with a piece of polycarbonate. This would prevent us from getting lifted onto our front side, and gave us more mobility when we were upside down. Some time before this fight, it started raining, and water was being tracked into the arena by people entering it. This made the floor so slick it was nearly impossible to control our robots. Even our opponent, Wall-F, who's whole strategy revolved around control its opponent, was having trouble driving. Something went so wrong on Wall-F that it just stopped, even without any significant impacts. I'm not really sure what happened, but we got the win and advanced to the finals undefeated.

Our fifth fight, the finals, was against Wall-F again. Since Robobrawl is double elimination, the robot that wins the losing bracket goes on to fight the winner of the winning bracket, which meant we were fighting Wall-F again. We followed the same strategy, but fortunately this time the organizers got all the water out of the arena and we both had traction again. Before the fight, in an effort to get underneath our wedgelets, Wall-F sharpened the forks on the lifter mechanism to a fine point. This ended up being quite problematic, as the lifter got stuck underneath the pannels of the floor and the wall of the arena multiple times. A significant impact with the wall left Wall-F stuck long enough to be counted out, making Absaluki 3: Revenge of the Absaluki the undefeated chamption of Robobrawl 2019.
