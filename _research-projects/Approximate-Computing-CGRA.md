Approximate computing has emerged as a new computing paradigm capable of reducing the power requirements for or accelerating some workloads. Due to cascading error and the nature of binary arithmetic, it is difficult to predict the exact effects that approximation may have on an error tolerant workload. In this work, we implemented configurable levels of approximation into a Coarse Grained Reconfigurable Architecture (CGRA) to study the effects of error tolerant algorithms on an approximate CGRA. We will use the CGRA Compilation Framework which simulates a CGRA using gem5, and we will implement the approximate hardware using multiple different approximate arithmetic modules included in Low Power Approximate Computing Library. Finally, we will perform a hardware level simulation on approximate modules to estimate the reduction in power from using approximate hardware.

This project was the result of my Honors Thesis at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.
