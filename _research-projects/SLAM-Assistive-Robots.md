SLAM on Assistive Robotics is a project to place a 3D LiDAR on a wheelchair and perform SLAM using the LiDAR as the primary sensor. We collected data by driving the wheelchair around and testing different SLAM algorithms and their effectiveness. We focused on using LeGO-LOAM as our SLAM Algorithm, however prior to completion, the project was shut down due to the Covid-19 Pandemic.
