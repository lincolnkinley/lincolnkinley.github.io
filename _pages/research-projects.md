    title: "Approximate Computing in CGRAs"
    excerpt: "Traditional computing focuses on optimizing two of these three: Speed, Power, and Generality. To accomplish all three simultaneously, we propose reducing the accuracy of computations through approxmiate computing."

    title: "Edge First Computing"
    excerpt: "Network edge devices using cloud computing often suffer from high latency, which can degrade latency sensitive applications. By managing computational resources at the network edge, we can create a scalable solution for low latency data processing on network edge devices."
