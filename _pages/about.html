<p>
I am currently a Sofware Engineer in the Boston Area.
  
I graduated with a Master's Degree in Robotics at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. 
While I was working on my degree, I worked in the 
<a href="https://fieldroboticslab.ece.northeastern.edu/">NEU Field Robotics Lab</a>
on using thermal cameras to generate visual odometry in environments where traditional cameras would
fail.
</p>
<p>
I received two Honors Bachelors Degrees in Computer Engineering and Electrical Engineering from 
Southern Illinois University Carbondale. While studying at SIUC, I wrote my Honors Thesis on 
<a href="https://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/uhp_theses/460/">Approximate Computing with Course Grained Reconfigurable Architecture.</a>

</p>
<p>
I'm passionate about all things robotic, and I've worked on many personal projects involving 
robotics. One of my personal favorites is my work on the Robot 
<a href="/robotics-projects/Winston/">"Winston"</a>, who went on to win first
place overall at the 2017 ATMAE National Robotics Competition.
